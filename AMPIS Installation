Installation
AMPIS depends on several packages, including PyTorch and Detectron2. The PyTorch installation depends on the available CUDA environment. Detectron2 depends on both the PyTorch installation and available CUDA environment. Therefore, the process is as follows. First, clone the repository, create a virtual environment, and install the standard python packages used by AMPIS. Then, install PyTorch according to your system. Next, install the corresponding Detectron2 build. Finally, install AMPIS.

1) Clone git repository
-      git clone https://github.com/rccohn/AMPIS.git
-      cd AMPIS
2) Set up and activate virtual environment
To create and activate an environment called ampis_env:

-      python3 -m venv ampis_env
-      source ampis_env/bin/activate
3) Install requirements file
-      pip install -r requirements.txt
Note- you may see some error messages pop up, but this is ok- pip should resolve the conflicts.

4) Install COCO Python API
Note pip install pycocotools does not work in some cases, I found this method to be better:

-      pip install git+https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git#subdirectory=PythonAPI
5) Install PyTorch and TorchVision
The version of torch and torchvision will depend on your system and cuda installation. For more information, see https://pytorch.org/.

For example, for installing pytorch 1.5 and the compatible version of torchvision for CUDA 10.1:

-      pip install torch==1.5.0+cu101 torchvision==0.6.0+cu101 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html

-----------------------------------edit-----------------------------------------
There is a high chance that that method will not work. If it doesn't, try:
-      TMPDIR=/var/tmp pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6) Install Detectron2
The version of detectron2 will depend on the versions of pytorch and CUDA installed on your system. There are different methods of installation. For Linux, the most straightforward method is to install a pre-built wheel. For other operating systems, detectron2 can be built from source, see their documentation for more info.

For pytorch 1.5 + CUDA 10.1:

-      python -m pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu101/torch1.5/index.html
More detailed information and additional builds can be found on the detectron2 installation page.

--------------------------------edit------------------------------------------
There is a high chance that that method will not work. If it doesn't, try:
-      python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'
-      python setup.py build develop
-      python -m pip install -U scikit-image
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

7) Install AMPIS
The recommended method for installing AMPIS is with pip's 'editable' mode. After navigating to AMPIS/:

-      pip install -e .
8) Verify installation
To verify everything is correctly installed, open a python terminal and enter the following:

import pycocotools
import torch
import detectron2
import ampis
If the modules import without errors, you are good to go!
